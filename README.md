## üíé Diamond Guest Wall ‚Äì Coming Soon

At **Diamond Santa Cruz**, we believe luxury is more than just comfort ‚Äî it's unforgettable *moments*. We're curating a **private, invitation-only showcase** featuring real clients enjoying our most iconic stays and experiences across Santa Cruz.

### What is the *Diamond Guest Wall*?

A discreet, visually stunning gallery of:

* Real guests (with permission) living the Diamond lifestyle
* Showcase moments from luxury villas, exclusive parties, curated tours
* Optional client shout-outs (for artists, influencers, or VIPs)

This feature helps future guests explore the **vibe and style** of our curated offerings ‚Äî while giving past clients a chance to shine.

### How It Works

* üí¨ *Always With Consent*: We only post photos or videos after obtaining your written permission.
* üîí *Private, Controlled Access*: Some posts may appear on our main site; others remain behind a private VIP wall.
* üéÅ *Optional Perks*: From upgrades to exclusive offers, we love thanking guests who allow us to share their story.
